**Abstract:**
Rising sea levels pose a significant threat to coastal cities,
increasing the risk of extreme sea levels, flooding, and coastal
erosion. Understanding the drivers of extreme sea levels, particularly
those caused by storm surges, is crucial for flood risk assessment and
management. This study develops a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal
model to estimate extreme sea levels at both gauged and ungauged
locations in Ireland, using data from the Global Extreme Sea Level
Analysis (GESLA) database, which includes tide-gauge records from
Ireland and the West coast of Great Britain (GBR). The Generalised
Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is used to model annual maxima,
incorporating spatial dependence through a Matérn covariance function
and temporal dependence via a first-order autoregressive (AR1) process.
The modelling framework ensures a flexible representation of spatial
correlation structures, capturing complex dependencies along the
coastline using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE)
approach with a barrier model. Model assessment is conducted using
multiple performance criteria, including Deviance Information Criterion
(DIC), Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC), and Conditional
Predictive Ordinates (CPO), with a particular focus on predictive power.
The results highlight the importance of spatio-temporal interactions in
capturing extreme sea-level variability, with models incorporating both
spatial structure and temporal trends providing improved predictive
performance. The findings indicate a statistically significant
increasing trend in extreme sea levels, with higher-risk areas
identified along Ireland’s East coast, where return level estimates
suggest an increased probability of extreme sea-level exceedances in the
coming decades. By integrating spatial and temporal dependencies within
a Bayesian framework, this study provides a realistic representation of
extreme sea-level propagation along the coast, enhancing flood risk
assessments and coastal management strategies. These insights are
critical for policymakers and stakeholders in developing informed
adaptation strategies for rising sea levels.
