    "text": "Past and Future Sea-level Changes in Cork Harbour Region: ‘It’s All For the Birds’!?\nAuthor: Robert Devoy\nAbstract:\nCork Harbour constitutes the outer and the main part of the estuary of the River Lee. It contains long (&gt;28m thick) sedimentary sequences of gravels, sands, silts and clays of Late Quaternary to late Holocene ages. Radiocarbon dating of the base of these sediments south of Spike Island (the Curlane Bank) has given a date of c.8,000 BP at heights of c.-12m ODM for postglacial sea-level rise and the marine inundation of the region. Stratigraphic and dating work at the Harper’s Island wetlands, in the back harbour area, has recently given new detail to the later Holocene phases of this flooding. Spring tidal ranges in the estuary reach commonly values of c.3.5 - 4m (meso- to macro-tidal), with storm surges raising this to c.5m height in Cork city and the inner estuary; with the frequent overtopping of river walls, port jetties and sea defences. This marine water blockage of the river has historically created major flooding problems for Cork city centre. Under future climate change and sea level rise, this surge flooding forms a significant vulnerability for the city and the adjacent harbour lowlands and has generated a current controversy about appropriate policy and approaches for coastal flood management control, both for Cork and nationally."

    "text": "A global analysis on coastal migration due to sea-level rise\nAuthor: Caridad Ballesteros\nAffiliation: The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research\nAbstract:\nSea-level rise (SLR) through the 21st century and beyond is inevitable, inundating coastal areas more frequently and displacing inhabitants unless there is appropriate adaptation. We investigate the impacts of SLR on coastal migration if plausible adaptation is considered. Adaptation is implemented based on the most economically robust adaptation option, by comparing protection versus retreat, with the latter option leading to migration. People living in unprotected coastal areas that are inundated frequently are assumed to migrate and the land is lost. Considering protection substantially reduces the number of migrants, as this can be a cost-efficient adaptation option in reducing the impacts of SLR especially in highly populated coastal areas. Coastal regions with less resources, and Small Island States, will suffer the most due to SLR unless adaptation, including planned migration, is well prepared in advance."

    "title": "Near-term sea-level projections for Southeast Asia",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Near-term sea-level projections for Southeast Asia\nAuthor: Trina Ng\nAffiliation: Nanyang Technological University\nAbstract:\nCoastal cities in Southeast Asia face heightened risks from relative sea-level (RSL) rise due to rapid urban expansion, limited observational coverage, and the coarse resolution of global projections. Vertical land motion (VLM) can influence RSL change by up to an order of magnitude, introducing substantial local variability to otherwise regionally uniform projections. This study presents a Bayesian hierarchical model to generate near-term RSL projections to 2050 using 96 annual tide gauge records across Southeast Asia. The model employs a change-point regression with an autoregressive time-series structure, enabling it to capture local, non-linear sea-level trajectories driven by both climatic variability and anthropogenic forcing. Of the 96 stations, 63 are located in urban coastal settings. Our results show that Bangkok and Manila are expected to experience the highest RSL rise among Southeast Asian cities, with median increases of 0.37 m (66% CI: 0.26–0.47 m) and 0.32 m (0.23–0.39 m), respectively, by 2050 relative to a 2020 baseline. Comparison with IPCC AR6 projections reveals broad agreement in overall trends, though our model systematically projects lower median trajectories, particularly under high-emissions scenarios. The discrepancy at some stations reflects the model’s ability to incorporate site-specific local changes, such as a significant reduction of groundwater extraction in Bangkok, which is not captured by the IPCC AR6 projections. This observation-driven framework provides a computationally efficient, empirically grounded complement to process-based projections."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sea level rise and storm surges around Ireland: Climate modelling at Met Éireann\nAuthor: Tido Semmler\nAffiliation: Met Éireann\nAbstract:\nObserved regional differences in sea level rise around Ireland, with some coastal urban centres experiencing rates exceeding global averages, underscore the critical need for future projections at regional and local scales to inform robust adaptation measures. The lack of high-resolution local sea level projections suitable for detailed adaptation planning has been identified as a significant gap in Ireland’s Climate Change Assessment. The National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) supports the imperative for developing such local projections to meet stakeholder requirements. Addressing this challenge necessitates a sophisticated multi-scale modelling approach. This ranges from refining global climate models (10-100 km), with a particular focus on achieving realistic Greenland and Antarctic melt input, to deploying regional coupled climate models around Ireland that include tidal dynamics (1-10 km), and finally to implementing local coastal inundation models for densely populated areas like Dublin Bay (10-100 m). Met Éireann plans to employ two postdoctoral researchers to work on modelling sea level rise, storm surge, and coastal flooding in collaboration with the Irish Centre for High End Computing (ICHEC), the Marine Institute (MI), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) as well as with European projects. An initial assessment of global climate model simulated Greenland meltwater input shows that the meltwater input is underestimated in global climate model simulations in the last two decades in which a substantial increase of Greenland melt has been observed. This has been corrected in sensitivity simulations, and further refinements of the simulations are subject of ongoing development."

    "title": "Bayesian Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Model for Extreme Sea-Level Prediction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Bayesian Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Model for Extreme Sea-Level Prediction\nAuthor: Fernando Mayer\nAffiliation Maynooth University\nAbstract: Rising sea levels pose a significant threat to coastal cities, increasing the risk of extreme sea levels, flooding, and coastal erosion. Understanding the drivers of extreme sea levels, particularly those caused by storm surges, is crucial for flood risk assessment and management. This study develops a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model to estimate extreme sea levels at both gauged and ungauged locations in Ireland, using data from the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis (GESLA) database, which includes tide-gauge records from Ireland and the West coast of Great Britain (GBR). The Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is used to model annual maxima, incorporating spatial dependence through a Matérn covariance function and temporal dependence via a first-order autoregressive (AR1) process. The modelling framework ensures a flexible representation of spatial correlation structures, capturing complex dependencies along the coastline using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach with a barrier model. Model assessment is conducted using multiple performance criteria, including Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC), and Conditional Predictive Ordinates (CPO), with a particular focus on predictive power. The results highlight the importance of spatio-temporal interactions in capturing extreme sea-level variability, with models incorporating both spatial structure and temporal trends providing improved predictive performance. The findings indicate a statistically significant increasing trend in extreme sea levels, with higher-risk areas identified along Ireland’s East coast, where return level estimates suggest an increased probability of extreme sea-level exceedances in the coming decades. By integrating spatial and temporal dependencies within a Bayesian framework, this study provides a realistic representation of extreme sea-level propagation along the coast, enhancing flood risk assessments and coastal management strategies. These insights are critical for policymakers and stakeholders in developing informed adaptation strategies for rising sea levels."

    "text": "Evaluating the sensitivity of threshold selection in Extreme value methods\nAuthor: Darshana Jayakumari\nAffiliation Met Éireann\nAbstract: A recent report published by Met Éireann has highlighted an increased risk of extreme precipitation events across Ireland in future years, which can pose a threat to life and property. Having a comprehensive understanding of the probability distribution of extreme rainfall in Ireland is key to obtaining accurate predictions of such events. It is also important to take into account spatial dependencies when producing these predictions. Extreme value theory is a statistical framework that can be utilised in modelling extreme events. This methodology has a wide variety of applications, including finance, healthcare, telecommunications, and climate. Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distributions are continuous probability distributions included useful to model extreme values. Depending on the behaviour of the tails of the sample distribution, the GEV distribution can be represented by Fréchet, Weibull or Gumbel distributions. An alternative way of modelling extremes is by using a threshold to capture the variability of exceedences using Generalised Pareto Distribution(GPD). In this talk we intend to examine the sensitivity of threshold selection by modelling 80 years of rainfall data from 10 weather stations across Ireland using GEV and GPD analysis. We also looked at the 10-year and 100-year return periods alongside 95% confidence intervals for each site. Preliminary results from the study show that subjective selection of thresholds would lead to wider confidence intervals and sensitive estimates."

    "text": "Storm Éowyn: What Can Be Learned from Irish Tidal Gauges\nAuthor: Indiana Olbert\nAffiliation University of Galway\nAbstract: Storm Éowyn of January 2025 is a severe weather event, mostly remembered for its extremely strong wind and short-term rainfall, causing significant devastation, disruption, and property damage throughout Ireland. While local flooding was also reported in some areas, it is generally considered of a much lesser importance in terms of its impact. In this study we examine available data from tidal gauges located along the Irish coastline to access impact of the storm Éowyn in terms of potential flooding of vulnerable areas. It was found that at some locations, notably Galway Port and Limerick Dock, the storm surge, estimated as the difference between measured water level and water level due regular tidal cycle at the same location and time, reaches value of 2.6 and 3.0 meters respectively, the highest on record within the available data. Lesser, but comparable values were found in other locations. So we were incredibly lucky that the storm happened during neap tide, when the tides are naturally the weakest, and, furthermore, the maximum wind and the sea level surge caused by the storm coincide with the time when tide was in the receding phase, thus tide acting against the surge and mitigating its impact."

    "text": "Integrating upper beach morphodynamics into future storm risk: A storyline approach under sea level rise\nAuthor: Abbie Nugent\nAffiliation: Trinity College Dublin\nAbstract: Dublin Bay is experiencing an accelerated rate of sea level rise (Nejad et al., 2022). This trend significantly amplifies the risk of storm-induced coastal hazards for the urban shoreline of Dublin. North Bull Island, a dynamic sandy barrier island located within the bay, plays a critical role in buffering the coastline from these hazards. Despite its importance as a “natural” coastal protection, the potential impact of future storms on the landform under sea level rise scenarios has not been explored. This study presents a novel application of a climate storyline approach to investigate future storm impacts on Dollymount Strand, North Bull Island. Using a calibrated 1D XBeach storm impact model, we evaluate a range of plausible future conditions, incorporating sea level rise projections, storm event characteristics, and upper beach morphological states, and their influence on storm impacts at three locations. By integrating morphological variability, this method provides a more comprehensive assessment of potential storm impacts than storyline approaches that take no consideration of geomorphological evolution. Our results emphasize the limitations of conventional static inundation models that don’t consider geomorphological processes that can have a direct impact on future climate risks at the coast.\nNejad, A.
