    "text": "Past and Future Sea-level Changes in Cork Harbour Region: ‘It’s All For the Birds’!?\nAuthor: Robert Devoy\nAbstract:\nCork Harbour constitutes the outer and the main part of the estuary of the River Lee. It contains long (&gt;28m thick) sedimentary sequences of gravels, sands, silts and clays of Late Quaternary to late Holocene ages. Radiocarbon dating of the base of these sediments south of Spike Island (the Curlane Bank) has given a date of c.8,000 BP at heights of c.-12m ODM for postglacial sea-level rise and the marine inundation of the region. Stratigraphic and dating work at the Harper’s Island wetlands, in the back harbour area, has recently given new detail to the later Holocene phases of this flooding. Spring tidal ranges in the estuary reach commonly values of c.3.5 - 4m (meso- to macro-tidal), with storm surges raising this to c.5m height in Cork city and the inner estuary; with the frequent overtopping of river walls, port jetties and sea defences. This marine water blockage of the river has historically created major flooding problems for Cork city centre. Under future climate change and sea level rise, this surge flooding forms a significant vulnerability for the city and the adjacent harbour lowlands and has generated a current controversy about appropriate policy and approaches for coastal flood management control, both for Cork and nationally."

    "text": "A global analysis on coastal migration due to sea-level rise\nAuthor: Caridad Ballesteros\nAffiliation: The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research\nAbstract:\nSea-level rise (SLR) through the 21st century and beyond is inevitable, inundating coastal areas more frequently and displacing inhabitants unless there is appropriate adaptation. We investigate the impacts of SLR on coastal migration if plausible adaptation is considered. Adaptation is implemented based on the most economically robust adaptation option, by comparing protection versus retreat, with the latter option leading to migration. People living in unprotected coastal areas that are inundated frequently are assumed to migrate and the land is lost. Considering protection substantially reduces the number of migrants, as this can be a cost-efficient adaptation option in reducing the impacts of SLR especially in highly populated coastal areas. Coastal regions with less resources, and Small Island States, will suffer the most due to SLR unless adaptation, including planned migration, is well prepared in advance."

    "title": "Near-term sea-level projections for Southeast Asia",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Near-term sea-level projections for Southeast Asia\nAuthor: Trina Ng\nAffiliation: Nanyang Technological University\nAbstract:\nCoastal cities in Southeast Asia face heightened risks from relative sea-level (RSL) rise due to rapid urban expansion, limited observational coverage, and the coarse resolution of global projections. Vertical land motion (VLM) can influence RSL change by up to an order of magnitude, introducing substantial local variability to otherwise regionally uniform projections. This study presents a Bayesian hierarchical model to generate near-term RSL projections to 2050 using 96 annual tide gauge records across Southeast Asia. The model employs a change-point regression with an autoregressive time-series structure, enabling it to capture local, non-linear sea-level trajectories driven by both climatic variability and anthropogenic forcing. Of the 96 stations, 63 are located in urban coastal settings. Our results show that Bangkok and Manila are expected to experience the highest RSL rise among Southeast Asian cities, with median increases of 0.37 m (66% CI: 0.26–0.47 m) and 0.32 m (0.23–0.39 m), respectively, by 2050 relative to a 2020 baseline. Comparison with IPCC AR6 projections reveals broad agreement in overall trends, though our model systematically projects lower median trajectories, particularly under high-emissions scenarios. The discrepancy at some stations reflects the model’s ability to incorporate site-specific local changes, such as a significant reduction of groundwater extraction in Bangkok, which is not captured by the IPCC AR6 projections. This observation-driven framework provides a computationally efficient, empirically grounded complement to process-based projections."

    "text": "Sea level rise and storm surges around Ireland: Climate modelling at Met Éireann\nAuthor: Tido Semmler\nAffiliation: Met Éireann\nAbstract:\nObserved regional differences in sea level rise around Ireland, with some coastal urban centres experiencing rates exceeding global averages, underscore the critical need for future projections at regional and local scales to inform robust adaptation measures. The lack of high-resolution local sea level projections suitable for detailed adaptation planning has been identified as a significant gap in Ireland’s Climate Change Assessment. The National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) supports the imperative for developing such local projections to meet stakeholder requirements. Addressing this challenge necessitates a sophisticated multi-scale modelling approach. This ranges from refining global climate models (10-100 km), with a particular focus on achieving realistic Greenland and Antarctic melt input, to deploying regional coupled climate models around Ireland that include tidal dynamics (1-10 km), and finally to implementing local coastal inundation models for densely populated areas like Dublin Bay (10-100 m). Met Éireann plans to employ two postdoctoral researchers to work on modelling sea level rise, storm surge, and coastal flooding in collaboration with the Irish Centre for High End Computing (ICHEC), the Marine Institute (MI), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) as well as with European projects. An initial assessment of global climate model simulated Greenland meltwater input shows that the meltwater input is underestimated in global climate model simulations in the last two decades in which a substantial increase of Greenland melt has been observed. This has been corrected in sensitivity simulations, and further refinements of the simulations are subject of ongoing development."
